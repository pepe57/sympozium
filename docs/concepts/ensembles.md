# Ensembles

Ensembles are the **recommended way to get started** with Sympozium. A Ensemble is a CRD that bundles multiple pre-configured agent personas — each with a system prompt, skills, tool policy, schedule, and memory seeds. Activating a pack is a single action: the Ensemble controller stamps out all the Kubernetes resources automatically.

## Why Ensembles?

Without Ensembles, setting up even one agent requires creating a Secret, SympoziumInstance, SympoziumSchedule, and memory ConfigMap by hand. Ensembles collapse that into: pick a pack → enter your API key → done.

## How It Works

```
Ensemble "platform-team" (3 personas)
  │
  ├── Activate via TUI or Web UI (wizard → API key → confirm)
  │
  └── Controller stamps out:
      ├── Secret: platform-team-openai-key
      ├── SympoziumInstance: platform-team-security-guardian
      │   ├── SympoziumSchedule: ...security-guardian-schedule (every 30m)
      │   └── ConfigMap: ...security-guardian-memory (seeded)
      ├── SympoziumInstance: platform-team-sre-watchdog
      │   ├── SympoziumSchedule: ...sre-watchdog-schedule (every 5m)
      │   └── ConfigMap: ...sre-watchdog-memory (seeded)
      ├── SympoziumInstance: platform-team-platform-engineer
      │   ├── SympoziumSchedule: ...platform-engineer-schedule (weekdays 9am)
      │   └── ConfigMap: ...platform-engineer-memory (seeded)
      │
      └── (if sharedMemory.enabled):
          ├── PVC: platform-team-shared-memory-db
          ├── Deployment: platform-team-shared-memory
          └── Service: platform-team-shared-memory
```

All generated resources have `ownerReferences` pointing back to the Ensemble — delete the pack and everything gets garbage-collected.

## Persona Relationships & Workflows

Ensembles support **typed relationships** between personas, enabling coordination patterns beyond independent scheduling:

### Relationship Types

| Type | Behaviour | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `delegation` | Source requests target, awaits result, then continues | Researcher delegates to Writer |
| `sequential` | Source must complete before target starts | Writer finishes → Reviewer begins |
| `supervision` | Source monitors target (observability only) | Lead supervises Writer and Reviewer |

### Workflow Types

The `workflowType` field on a Ensemble describes the overall orchestration pattern:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `autonomous` | Default. Personas run independently on their own schedules. |
| `pipeline` | Personas execute in sequence defined by `sequential` edges. |
| `delegation` | Personas can actively delegate to each other at runtime. |

### Defining Relationships

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Ensemble
metadata:
  name: research-team
spec:
  workflowType: delegation
  personas:
    - name: researcher
      systemPrompt: "You are a research analyst..."
    - name: writer
      systemPrompt: "You are a technical writer..."
    - name: reviewer
      systemPrompt: "You are a quality reviewer..."
  relationships:
    - source: researcher
      target: writer
      type: delegation
      timeout: "10m"
      resultFormat: markdown
    - source: writer
      target: reviewer
      type: sequential
      timeout: "5m"
```

## Shared Workflow Memory

By default, each persona in a Ensemble has its own **private memory** — an isolated SQLite database that only that persona can access. Shared Workflow Memory adds a second, **pack-level memory pool** that all personas can read from (and optionally write to), enabling cross-persona knowledge sharing.

### Enabling Shared Memory

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Ensemble
metadata:
  name: research-team
spec:
  sharedMemory:
    enabled: true
    storageSize: "1Gi"
    accessRules:
      - persona: lead
        access: read-write
      - persona: researcher
        access: read-write
      - persona: writer
        access: read-write
      - persona: reviewer
        access: read-only
```

### How It Works

When shared memory is enabled, the Ensemble controller provisions:

- **PVC**: `<pack>-shared-memory-db` — persistent storage for the shared SQLite database
- **Deployment**: `<pack>-shared-memory` — the same `skill-memory` server image used for private memory
- **Service**: `<pack>-shared-memory` — ClusterIP service on port 8080

All resources have `ownerReferences` to the Ensemble and are cleaned up on deletion.

### Agent Tools

Agents in the pack receive three additional tools alongside their private memory tools:

| Tool | Description | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `workflow_memory_search` | Search shared team knowledge contributed by any persona | All |
| `workflow_memory_store` | Store findings for other personas (auto-tagged with source persona) | read-write only |
| `workflow_memory_list` | List shared entries, filterable by persona or tag | All |

### Access Control

Each persona can be granted `read-write` or `read-only` access via `accessRules`. If no rules are specified, all personas default to `read-write`.

- **read-write**: Can search, list, and store entries
- **read-only**: Can search and list, but cannot store (the `workflow_memory_store` tool is not registered)

Access control is enforced client-side in the agent runner — sufficient because the memory server is in-cluster behind a ClusterIP with no untrusted clients.

### Auto-Context Injection

When an agent starts, the runner automatically queries both private and shared memory for task-relevant context. The system prompt includes two sections:

- **Your Past Findings (Private Memory)** — from the persona's own memory
- **Team Knowledge (Shared Workflow Memory)** — from the pack's shared pool

### Attribution

Entries stored via `workflow_memory_store` are automatically tagged with the source persona's instance name. This enables filtering by persona (e.g., "show me what the researcher found") without relying on agents to self-tag correctly.

### delegate_to_persona Tool

Agents that belong to a Ensemble automatically receive the `delegate_to_persona` tool. This allows an agent to delegate a task to another persona in the same pack:

```
Tool: delegate_to_persona
Arguments:
  targetPersona: "writer"
  task: "Write a report based on these findings: ..."
```

The tool writes a spawn request to the IPC protocol. The spawner resolves the target persona to the correct SympoziumInstance, validates the relationship edge exists, and creates a child AgentRun.

### Visual Canvas

The Web UI provides two canvas views for visualising persona relationships:

- **Per-pack canvas** (Persona detail page → Workflow tab): editable — drag to connect personas, pick relationship type, save back to the CRD
- **Global canvas** (Ensembles list page → Canvas view): read-only — shows all enabled packs together with live run status
- **Dashboard widget** (Team Canvas panel): compact view with pack selector dropdown and live run status highlighting

Persona nodes show live run status with animated indicators:

- **Running**: pulsing blue ring + task preview
- **Serving**: pulsing violet ring
- **AwaitingDelegate**: pulsing amber ring
- **Failed**: red ring
- **Succeeded**: green ring

## Built-in Packs

| Pack | Category | Agents | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `platform-team` | Platform | Security Guardian, SRE Watchdog, Platform Engineer | Core platform engineering — security audits, cluster health, manifest review |
| `devops-essentials` | DevOps | Incident Responder, Cost Analyzer | DevOps workflows — incident triage, resource right-sizing |
| `developer-team` | Development | Tech Lead, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, QA Engineer, Code Reviewer, DevOps Engineer, Docs Writer | A 2-pizza software development team that collaborates on a single GitHub repository |
| `research-team` | Research | Lead, Researcher, Writer, Reviewer | A coordinated research and reporting team demonstrating delegation, sequential, and supervision relationships |
| `observability-mcp-team` | Observability | Grafana Analyst, Log Investigator | Observability workflows using MCP servers for Grafana and Loki |

## Activating a Pack in the Web UI

1. Navigate to **Ensembles** in the sidebar
2. Click **Enable** on a pack to open the onboarding wizard
3. Choose your AI provider and paste an API key
4. Optionally bind channels (Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp)
5. Confirm — the controller creates all instances within seconds

## Activating via kubectl

```yaml
# 1. Create the provider secret
kubectl create secret generic my-pack-openai-key \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# 2. Patch the Ensemble with authRefs to trigger activation
kubectl patch ensemble platform-team --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "authRefs": [{"provider": "openai", "secret": "my-pack-openai-key"}]
  }
}'
```

The controller detects the `authRefs` change and reconciles — creating SympoziumInstances, Schedules, and memory ConfigMaps for each persona.

## Writing Your Own Ensemble

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Ensemble
metadata:
  name: my-team
spec:
  description: "My custom agent team"
  category: custom
  version: "1.0.0"
  workflowType: delegation
  personas:
    - name: planner
      displayName: "Planner"
      systemPrompt: |
        You plan work and delegate to the executor.
      skills:
        - k8s-ops
        - memory
      schedule:
        type: heartbeat
        interval: "1h"
        task: "Check for pending work and delegate to the executor."
    - name: executor
      displayName: "Executor"
      systemPrompt: |
        You execute tasks assigned by the planner.
      skills:
        - k8s-ops
        - memory
  relationships:
    - source: planner
      target: executor
      type: delegation
      timeout: "15m"
```

Apply it with `kubectl apply -f my-team.yaml`, then activate through the Web UI or TUI.
